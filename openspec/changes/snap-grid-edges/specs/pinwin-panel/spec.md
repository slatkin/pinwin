# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Seamless cell grid at any output scale
The panel SHALL snap the edges of every rectangle in the cell grid to whole device pixels.
These rectangles are the cell backgrounds, the block glyphs, the cursor, and the underline
and strikethrough bands. Block glyphs are the full, half, eighth, quadrant and braille
blocks. Two cells that share an edge SHALL get the same snapped edge. No line or seam SHALL
be visible between cells at any output scale, fractional or integer.

The grid's offset from the docked edge SHALL be a whole number of device pixels in every
frame, including each frame of a width animation. When the output scale changes, the panel
SHALL redraw the grid at the new scale. The fallback painter SHALL meet the same rules.

Snapping SHALL NOT change the cell size, the panel width or any size that the panel reports.
A bar, band or outline SHALL be at least one device pixel thick. Its thickness SHALL be
within one device pixel of its logical thickness times the output scale.

#### Scenario: Fractional scale has no seams
- **WHEN** the panel runs at an output scale of 1.5 and a region of cells has one background
  colour or holds full-block glyphs
- **THEN** the region shows one uniform colour with no lines between cells

#### Scenario: Integer scale has no seams
- **WHEN** the panel runs at an output scale of 1 or 2 and shows the same region
- **THEN** the region shows one uniform colour with no lines between cells

#### Scenario: Half blocks meet without a seam
- **WHEN** the panel runs at an output scale of 1.25 and a right-half block sits beside a
  left-half block of the same colour
- **THEN** the two blocks show one uniform colour with no line between them

#### Scenario: Width animation
- **WHEN** a width animation runs at an output scale of 1.5 on a right-docked panel
- **THEN** the grid's offset from the docked edge is a whole number of device pixels in
  every frame and no seam appears between cells

#### Scenario: Scale change
- **WHEN** the panel moves to an output with a different scale
- **THEN** the panel redraws the grid at the new scale and no seam appears between cells

#### Scenario: Fallback painter
- **WHEN** the fallback painter draws the grid at an output scale of 1.5
- **THEN** it snaps the same edges as the primary painter and no seam appears

#### Scenario: Bar cursor keeps its physical size
- **WHEN** the output scale is 1.5 and the cursor is a bar 2 logical pixels wide
- **THEN** the bar is 3 device pixels wide

#### Scenario: Sizes stay logical
- **WHEN** the output scale is 1.5
- **THEN** the cell size, the panel width and the reply to `CSI 16 t` equal their values at
  an output scale of 1
